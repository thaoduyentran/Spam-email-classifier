# Spam-email-classifier
In this project, I developed an SVM Classification models to predict spam/non-spam emails that achieved 83.6% and 92.3% accuracy. 
This model helps professionals filter spam emails to reduce email reading time and improve productivity. Using K-Fold Validation to evaluate model performance
and hyperameters in SVM to achieve the highest accuracy.
Spam is a data set collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs, that classifies 4601 e-mails as spam or non-spam.
