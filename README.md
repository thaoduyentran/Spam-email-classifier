# Spam-email-classifier
Spam is a data set collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs, that classifies 4601 e-mails as spam or non-spam. In addition to this class label there are 57 variables indicating the frequency of certain words and characters in the e-mail.

In this project, I developed an SVM Classification models to predict spam/non-spam emails that achieved 83.6% and 92.3% accuracy. 
This model helps professionals filter spam emails to reduce email reading time and improve productivity
